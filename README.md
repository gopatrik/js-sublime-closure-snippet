# JavaScript object closure snippet
This is [Douglas Crockford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford)'s new way of creating objects as closures in preparation of ES6.

Read and see him talk about it [here](http://bdadam.com/blog/video-douglas-crockford-about-the-new-good-parts.html).

This should mostly be used for singleton/low quantity objects, and might see performance issues if you are creating millions of objects (why are you using JavaScript?).

Just type ```closure(+tab)``` to trigger the snippet in a JavaScript environment, (in [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)).
